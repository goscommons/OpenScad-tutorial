Just copy and paste code, learn by trying and doing.

### Second part: Advanced design with openscad
- Reusing part libraries
- Customizing advanced models
- Studying, Contributing and sharing

Excercise: make a bearing

#### ðŸ”¨ Essential resources:
- [Thingiverse customizable models.](https://www.thingiverse.com/mathgrrl/collections/thingiverse-openscad-customizers)
> This is a very good example: [a parametric connector to make prototypes](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:593002)
