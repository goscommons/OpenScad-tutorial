# OpenSCAD üöÄ

## üê≤[What is OpenSCAD](http://spolearninglab.com/curriculum/lessonPlans/hacking/resources/software/3d/openscad_intro.html)
Its a free open source software to create 3D parts.
## üî® [How does it work](http://spolearninglab.com/curriculum/lessonPlans/hacking/resources/software/3d/openscad_intro.html)
OpenSCAD is not an interactive modeller. Instead it reads in statements that describes the object and it renders the 3D model from that code.
## Why OpenSCAD
- Full control the process and the model,
- Great maintanance experience.
- Great for team work and open collaboration

OpenSCAD provides two main modelling techniques:
Constructive Solid Geometry
Extrusion of 2D outlines


# Customizable modeling with OpenSCAD

Customizer is a simple way to make customized 3D Things that you can share, download and print! Customizer allows you to design parametric objects that can be customized with an easy web interface. You create your customizer files with OpenSCAD. To share your own file, upload your OpenSCAD script to Thingiverse and tag your Thing with the customizer tag.
