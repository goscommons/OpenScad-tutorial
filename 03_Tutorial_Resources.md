## What we will do today:
### First part: the basics
- Basic shapes and primitives
- Making simple customizable models
- Hacking openscad example
- Design something simple that you like customizable

#### 🔨 Essential tools
- [OpenSCAD cheat sheet](http://www.openscad.org/cheatsheet/)
Just copy and paste code, learn by trying the examples and changing parameters.
- OpenSCAD examples ➡️ Go to your openscad installation files and explore the examples provided.

### Second part: advanced design with openscad
- Reusing part libraries
- Customizing advanced models
- Studying, Contributing and sharing

Excercise: make a bearing

#### 🔨 Essential resources:
- [Thingiverse customizable models.](https://www.thingiverse.com/mathgrrl/collections/thingiverse-openscad-customizers)
> This is a very good example: [a parametric connector to make prototypes](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:593002)


## If you want to learn more about open source design and apply your openscad skills 👇
* Check out this project [Customizable modular connector system](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:623328). This is great case to apply customizable design.

* **Learn the open source way:** *use, study,* and *improve* others work.

* Share your work with others, it will make you more keen in making good designs and models.

* Contact me, we are working on open source designs to make sustainable impact.
